All work in this folder is based on the work of Malte D Luecken & Fabian J Theis on "Current best practices in single-cell RNA-seq analysis: a tutorial" (2019). The original paper can be found [here](https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/msb.20188746).

About the paper: "Here, we detail the steps of a typical single-cell RNA-seq analysis, including pre-processing (quality control, normalization, data correction, feature selection, and dimensionality reduction) and cell- and gene-level downstream analysis. We formulate current best-practice recommendations for these steps based on independent comparison studies. We have integrated these best-practice recommendations into a workflow, which we apply to a public dataset to further illustrate how these steps work in practice." Copied from paper abstract.
