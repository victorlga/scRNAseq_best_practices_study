# scRNAseq_study_space

## Introduction
This repository is my personal study space focused on single-cell RNA sequences. For every article I read, I will try to reproduce the results, and understand and take notes on fundamental concepts. I will also try to add some of my analysis and comments on the data.

Bigger projects will be in their repository but linked in the summary section below. This repository is for smaller projects and notes.

## Summary
1. [scRNAseq_analysis_sanbomics_tutorial](https://github.com/victorlga/scRNAseq_analysis_sanbomics_tutorial)

    This was the first scRNA-seq I have ever done. I faced lots of memory issues, given that my notebook didn't have enough RAM to load all the data. It was completely done to give me a general idea about what is a single-cell RNA sequence analysis, but was never completely run because the kernel kept crashing.

2. [Current best practices in single-cell RNA-seq analysis: a tutorial](/2019_best_practices_scRNAseq_tutorial)

    This is about a paper published in 2019 about single-cell RNA sequence best practices. It is not up to date, since I'm currently writing this summary in 2023, but it was a great source of learning.

3. [Testing methods for automatic cell type annotation](https://github.com/victorlga/scRNAseq_automatic_annotation)

   This repository is dedicated to testing automatic cell-type annotation methods.
